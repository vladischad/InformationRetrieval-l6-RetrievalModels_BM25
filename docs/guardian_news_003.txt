At least six people were killed and 37 injured late last night when a coach left the clockwise carriageway of the M25 between junctions 15 and 16 near Slough in Berkshire.
First reports said that the coach, which seats 57, was full. Some of the dead and injured had been thrown through the windows when the coach left the motorway   and overturned. 
A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Fire Service said that the coach was on its side in a field. Two of the injured were in a serious condition. Thirty-five were described as 'walking wounded'. 
The emergency services were called just after 11 o'clock last night. It was too early to say what had caused the accident, although no   other vehicle appeared to have been involved. 
A police spokesman said: 'It is a scene of mayhem, and obviously our first concern is dealing with the people who are trapped.' Hospitals in the area were on standby. 
In 1999 the EU passed legislation making it compulsory for all new vehicles to be fitted with seatbelts.
