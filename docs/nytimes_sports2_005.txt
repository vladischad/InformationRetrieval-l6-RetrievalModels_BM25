SHANGHAI, China (AP) --.

Top-ranked Lleyton Hewitt beat Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-5, 7-5, 2-6, 2-6, 6-4 Sunday to defend his title in the season-ending Masters Cup.
Hewitt ended the 3-hour, 51-minute match with a backhand lob that bounced a foot inside the baseline. The Australian then fell onto his back, his arms raised toward the ceiling.

"Every match this week was a grind," said Hewitt, who clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking on Thursday. "I had a couple three-hour matches and a four-hour match. I don't know how I held up."
It was a disappointing ending for Ferrero, the French Open runner-up. He served for the first set, but lost six straight games. He was up a break twice in the final set before Hewitt rallied, tying the set in the sixth game.
Both players battled nerves and exhaustion, sometimes missing badly and other times hitting brilliant winners. They each held serve until the 10th game.
Ferrero hit a forehand wide to open the game. After an ace, he hit an easy shot that Hewitt returned as a winner.
A backhand into the net by Ferrero gave Hewitt match point, but the Australian hit a forehand wide.
On the second match point, Ferrero hit a ball deep into the court and followed it to the net. Hewitt responded with the winning lob.
"When I won, it was a feeling of relief," Hewitt said. "Now I can put my feet up and go home."
Ferrero had mixed emotions.
"Right now I don't feel very happy," he said. "But if I'm thinking about the year, I have to be happy because I finish the year really playing good tennis."
Ferrero finished the season ranked No. 4, the first Spaniard since Sergi Bruguera in 1993-94 to finish in the top five in consecutive seasons.
Hewitt earned $700,000 for the victory.
