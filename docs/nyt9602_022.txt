EXPLOSION OF TWA FLIGHT 800 SPREADS PALL OVER AIRLINE'S OVERHAUL
BASE

   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  --  The deadly explosion of TWA Flight 800 spread
a pall over the airline's Kansas City overhaul base Thursday.

   ``We lost a lot of good people on that airplane,'' Roger Tyler,
a base mechanic, said as he sat at nearby Allie's Bar &amp; Grill after
his work shift ended Thursday afternoon. ``It's heart saddening.''

   Federal Aviation Administration records show that the jet that
crashed near New York paid what were considered routine visits to
the base, the airline's primary site for plane maintenance.

   Base workers said they and their colleagues wore Walkman radios
much of the work day, listening for word of what ignited the 747
explosion.

   The cause of the crash was unknown, and that uncertainty grated
on the beefy, bearded Tyler.

   ``I would hate to think that this was maintenance,'' he said
over the muted babblings of a TV talk show. ``As long as I've
worked at TWA, I've never seen bad maintenance. Everybody's so
conscientious. The training takes years. It's not something you go
to night school for.''

   Other TWA workers at the bar described the mood at the base as
``pretty somber.''

   Steve Lacy, a mechanic who has worked at the base nearly 30
years, was subdued and somewhat stoic about the tragedy.

   ``I'm sorry for all those people that got killed,'' Lacy said.
``It's just one of those things. It could have been a bomb or
anything. You don't know what happened....There's nothing else I
can do.''

   Kathy Woodward, a bartender and waitress at the Final Approach
Pub near the base, said she served fewer TWA employees than normal
Thursday.

   ``The (TWA) people I had today were very down,'' Woodward said
amid the bar's vast collection of airline memorabilia. ``They were
glued to the TV. People were not themselves.''

   Tyler, who overhauls pumps that move fuel from the wings to the
engine, said working on aircraft is a high-pressure job, ``probably
right below being a doctor.''

   ``We take people's lives in our hands,'' he said. ``We don't
take it lightly. I'll stand behind every pump I ever build. When I
go home to sleep tonight, I'll know that isn't what caused that
crash.''

   Tyler insisted that the crash wouldn't impede TWA's financial
recovery after years of losses: ``We're coming back, and everybody
knows we're coming back.''

   Mechanics and other rank-and-file workers at the base belong to
Machinists Local 1650, which is overseen by Machinists District
142. Gary Poos, a District 142 official, said the union is ``fully
participating in this investigation.''

   Poos said William O'Driscoll, president of District 142, was at
the command post in New York.

   Poos said the union's ``deepest sympathy goes to the families
and friends of those who perished in this tragedy.''
