Prince Charles has won a court order banning a Sunday newspaper from publishing details of a book written by a former Royal housekeeper.
Lawyers acting for St James's Palace won an interim interdict banning the Glasgow-based Sunday Mail from printing details of the book.
The Prince's legal team had already banned Wendy Berry from telling her story after winning a court order in England in 1995, the newspaper said.
However, her book, the Housekeeper's Story, was later published in the US. The Prince's lawyers blocked the Sunday Mail from repeating details of Berry's account of life in the Royal household after going to court to extend the ban to Scotland.
An interim interdict banning the newspaper from describing the behaviour of the Prince and other Royals was awarded at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
