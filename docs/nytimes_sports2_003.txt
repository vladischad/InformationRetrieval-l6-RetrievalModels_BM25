LONDON (AP) -- . .

Manchester United star David Beckham could be sidelined for three weeks with a broken rib.
The England captain, who likely sustained the injury in an English Premier League win over Southampton two weeks ago, played in Wednesday's Champions League victory over Germany's Bayer Leverkusen.
But he was in pain after the match and tests revealed the injury. A Manchester United spokesman said Saturday that Beckham could be out for two-to-three weeks.
If he is sidelined for three weeks, Beckham would miss league matches against West Ham, Newcastle, Liverpool and Arsenal, the opening second group stage Champions League match at FC Basel and a League Cup fourth round tie at Burnley.
Beckham's absence is the latest injury blow for Manchester United, which is without captain Roy Keane, Rio Ferdinand and Nicky Butt.
It also means more frustration for Beckham, who almost missed the World Cup finals with a broken left foot.
