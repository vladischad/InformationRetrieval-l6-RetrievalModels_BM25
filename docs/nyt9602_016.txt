COLORADO STOCKS: UAL RISES 2.8% TO LEAD INDEX TO RECORD HIGH

   Denver, May 13 (Bloomberg) -- Colorado stocks climbed to a
record high as UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, rose in the
wake of the crash of a ValuJet Inc. DC-9 this weekend.

   The Bloomberg Colorado Stock Index rose 0.86, or 0.61 percent,
to 141.07. Advancers outnumbered decliners 48 to 35 in the
price-weighted index that tracks shares of companies with
operations in the state.

   In the broader U.S. stock market, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index rose 9.42, or 1.44 percent, to 661.51. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 64.46, or 1.17 percent, to 5582.60.

   UAL rose 6, or 2.8 percent, to 214, as the stocks of major U.S.
airlines registered their biggest one-day advance in almost a
month. The S&amp;P airline index rose 12.37 to 344.53, with investors
favoring established carriers over recent start-ups.

   UAL is included in Colorado's index because of its dominant
position in the state's economy.

   Investors said Saturday's crash of a ValuJet DC-9 in the Florida
Everglades cast a pall over the ability of fledgling airlines to
raise sufficient capital to replace older jets. The crash killed
109 people. ``People have been able to get financing fairly
readily,'' said Joseph Ray of Gerald L. Ray &amp; Associates, a Dallas
money management firm that oversees $500 million in assets. ``It
will be interesting to see what the capital markets say about all
this.''

   Among those carriers that Ray is watching is Colorado
Springs-based Western Pacific Airlines Inc., which fell 3/4 to 15
3/4 to lead the state's declining issues. Western Pacific hopes to
add eight aircraft to its 14-plane fleet by the end of 1996.

   Denver-based Frontier Airlines Inc., which fell 3/4 to 7 5/8, is
also growing. The airline, which marks its second anniversary in
July, is putting its eighth and ninth aircraft into service this
summer, and hopes to add at least a couple more Boeing 737s this
year.

   The state's other airline, cargo carrier Atlas Air Inc., fell
7/16 to 53 13/16.

   Other advancing stocks included Lockheed Martin Corp., up 2 n1/8
at 83 1/4; Amrion Inc., up 1 1/2 at 18 5/8; Exabyte Corp., up 5/8
at 20 5/8; and Newmont Mining Corp., up 5/8 at 59 1/8. Other
declining issues included Boston Chicken Inc., off 5/8 at 35 7/8,
even though it reported first-quarter profit doubled.

   Adolph Coors Co. fell 7/16 to 17 13/16, while FirstMiss Gold
Corp., dropped 3/8 to 37 5/8.

   The Colorado index has gained 18.62 percent since the first of
the year, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 7.40 percent advance.
