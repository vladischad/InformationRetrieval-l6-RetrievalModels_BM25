   WASHINGTON  --  A military plane carrying a Secret Service agent
and an Air Force crew of eight crashed into a mountain minutes
after taking off from President Clinton's Wyoming retreat late
Saturday night, killing everyone on board, officials said.

   The C-130 aircraft was carrying the Secret Service agent and an
automobile used by security officers in presidential motorcades. It
was bound from Jackson Hole, Wyo., where Clinton spent his holiday,
to New York City, where he was to attend a 50th birthday party
Sunday night.

   The plane took off from the Jackson Hole airport at about 10:45
p.m. Saturday night, according to state and local officials in
Wyoming and an Air Force spokesman in Texas, where the crew of the
plane was based.

   About three minutes later, after flying about 15 miles southeast
and reaching an altitude of about 10,000 feet, the C-130 slammed
into the side of Sheep Mountain, known locally as Sleeping Indian.
It exploded in a fireball visible in Teton Village, a resort town
20 miles away. The crash site was about 1,000 feet below the
11,300-foot summit.

   A party of 28 searchers set out for the remote site on foot and
on horseback a few hours later. But the impact of the explosion,
with the plane hitting the mountain above the timberline at 200
miles an hour or more with about 18 tons of fuel on board, was so
severe that they found little more than smouldering fragments.

   The C-130 has generally been considered an unusually safe
aircraft  --  a slow, fat, reliable workhorse, nicknamed the Hercules,
and is used mostly to haul people and equipment around the world.
But this crash was the third fatal one involving a C-130 in the
past 15 months.

   Four weeks ago, a C-130 flown by the Belgian Air Force crashed
in the Netherlands, killing 32 people, most of them members of a
Dutch military orchestra. And in May 1995, a C-130 carrying six Air
Force reservists went down in southern Idaho after an engine caught
fire, killing all aboard.

   Saturday night's crash was also the third time in the past 16
months that an Air Force plane has carried U.S. government
officials to their death.

   In April 1995, an Air Force C-21, a military version of a
Learjet executive aircraft, crashed in Alabama and killed Clark G.
Fiester, an assistant Air Force secretary. A year later, two Air
Force pilots trying to land their military Boeing 737 at Dubrovnik,
Croatia, flew straight into the highest peak for miles around,
killing all 35 people aboard, including Secretary of Commerce
Ronald H. Brown.

   A study of military aircraft mishaps published six months ago by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found that 73 percent of the most severe accidents in 1994 and 1995
were caused by human error, mistakes by pilots or, more rarely,
ground crews or air traffic controllers.

   At the White House, shortly before departing for New York,
Clinton said the deaths of the Secret Service agent and the Air
Force crew members were ``especially painful to us because they
worked for me and did an invaluable service, and I am very sad
about it.'' The president and his family had left Wyoming for
Washington a few hours before the crash on Saturday.
