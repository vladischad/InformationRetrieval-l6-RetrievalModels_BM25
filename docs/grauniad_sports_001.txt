Els plays the straight man

South African proves more than a match for the wayward Garcia

Ernie Els, playing the avuncular role to Sergio Garcia's slightly neurotic nephew, yesterday won the Cisco World Match Play Championship by 2&1.

It was a fitting end to a final few holes that had seen Garcia looking for miracles and finding only rhododendrons and rotting leaves.

Just when he needed to be strong off the tee the Spaniard, who is among the longest and straightest drivers on the US Tour, smashed two drives into deep trouble to end any hopes he had of making a recovery.

He had been five down after only 12 holes of the 36-hole final, was still three down after 28 and, although he fought back to be only one down with four to play, he was massively erratic from there on.

Els, 33, always amiable and apparently unperturbed, did what he had to do - hit fairways and greens - and, when Garcia surrendered on the 35th green, the South African had won his fourth World Match Play. He won �250,000 and is only one victory behind Severiano Ballesteros and Gary Player, who jointly hold the record.

"If I am this side of the ground," said Els afterwards, "I will be back next year. It is an ambition of mine to do what Seve and Gary did."

He is aware, though, that it would be for the best to win as much as he can as soon as he can. He already suffers because of the Tiger Factor and he can see more trouble ahead in the shape of the 22-year-old Sergio. "In 10 years' time," said Els, "I would expect Sergio to be close to the career grand slam. Unfortunately he is in the Tiger era but he has so much talent I think he can do it."

That is also the often expressed ambition of the South African, to win all four majors before he finishes, and winning the Open this year was, for him, a massive step in the right direction. That win and now this has made it a great year on the golf course. And now he has Ben, his two-week-old son. "It's just been a wonderful year all round," said Els, momentarily emotional.

Els was never behind in the three matches he played and agreed that maybe the aura of being Open champion helped. "If you get ahead and then just carry on hitting fairways and holing a few putts, the guys can't see how they can get back," he said. "I played solid all week but I think I holed all my putts [for the week] against Colin Montgomerie."

That was the match in which he was an approximate 12 under par for the first 18 holes and by last night he was 27 under for 100 holes played. By coincidence that was the exact same score as Garcia, but, as Els put it: "I hit fewer loose shots than he did." Towards the end of yesterday's match those loose shots became destructive, perhaps emphasising that, as the youngest ever finalist - he was eight days younger than when Tiger played in 1998 - he lacked just a little experience.

After going five down Garcia never quite threatened Els with equality, although when he holed an 18-footer at the 8th (26th) to go to one down, it looked as if he had established some momentum. But it vanished abruptly when his drive to the next, hit off the back foot and careering away in the general direction of long-off, disappeared into the trees.

Garcia danced down the tee, waving wildly above his head as if he were about to attempt a world record hammer throw. But he stopped and grinned: it was mock anger, as if he were taking the mickey out of himself, and he made strenuous, if unavailing, attempts to recover the situation.

But Els won the hole and it was not until the short 14th that Garcia was again able to threaten the South African. After his tee shot had spun back off the green, Els chipped to four feet and missed the putt for the half. If Garcia had known how that made Els feel, he might have been encouraged.

The South African said: "I put a bad stroke on that putt. I really felt I was in trouble. It was a miss that was hard to take."

But not only did Garcia fail to take advantage; he whipped his drive to the 16th so deep into the trees on the left that it took three marshals right on the spot several minutes to find his ball. The Spaniard had a left-handed swish with a reversed face wedge which moved it a couple of feet, into a ditch.

That meant two down with two to play and, when the Spaniard hit the precise same drive off the 17th, he had no chance of winning that hole either.

"Sometimes you go out there," said Sergio afterwards, "and your opponent plays better than you do. Ernie was the guy who played the best today and he deserved to be the winner."
