A senior Iraqi envoy has visited several Arab states to ask for asylum for key members of Saddam Hussein's regime in the event of its overthrow.
According to Western diplomatic sources, the envoy - General Ali Hasan al-Majid, known as 'Chemical Ali' to Iraqi Kurds for his role in the attack on Kurds at Halabja in 1988 - visited Algeria, Tunisia and Libya in September to sound out governments about asylum for senior Iraqi officials fleeing the collapse of the Ba'ath regime. 
Other reports have suggested that members of the regime have recently been in Syria to organise an overland route for Saddam's family to flee in the event of a massive US- led attack. However, all reports suggest Saddam himself would remain behind. 
Although it is possible the story is being circulated by Western intelligence agencies to undermine morale within the regime, it seems likely there is much truth in these accounts. 
The visit by al-Majid has coincided with approaches by dozens of Iraqi officials to states that might offer asylum, and with approaches to members of the Iraqi diaspora by middle-ranking officials to ascertain what any new regime's attitude might be towards them. 
According to the Times yesterday, al-Majid's visit to Libya was part of a �2.3 billion deal to secure asylum in Libya for members of Saddam's family and key associates, although not for Saddam himself or his son Uday. 
Libyan Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassouna al-Shawish labelled the Times report 'a fabrication', according to the official Libyan news agency, Jana. But diplomatic sources insisted al-Majid had been touring the region looking for sanctuary for members of Saddam's regime and family. 
'We know that al-Majid was touring the region in September,' said one source yesterday. 'And we know that key members of the regime have been making arrangements for places they could live in a post-Saddam world. These are members of Saddam's al-Tikrit clan and very senior members of his regime, who would be regarded as beyond the pale by any new regime and might justifiably fear for their lives. 
'These are not middle-ranking officials who might go for the Nuremburg defence that "they were only following orders", but the most senior officials who might fear for their lives.' 
Diplomatic sources do not believe the disclosure of plans by the Baathist regime to open an underground railroad out of Iraq for key officials amounts to evidence of an impending coup against Saddam. 
'This is not evidence of a coup,' said one British source. 'The security in this regime is so tight it would pick up any planning of a coup. But it is evidence that key officials - Saddam included - do not believe the regime would survive a US-led attack.' 
The source confirmed that evidence of the flight-not-fight instincts of so many key members of the regime was one reason behind the timing of Prime Minister Tony Blair's broadcast last week to Iraqis, criticising the Ba'athist regime and pointing out that Britain was not in conflict with ordinary Iraqis but with Saddam's regime. 
The disclosures came as chief United Nations weapons inspector Hans Blix warned yesterday that Iraq would face the full might of the UN Security Council if it failed to co- operate completely with inspectors looking for weapons of mass destruction. 
Blix has also warned that any intelligence agents found working among the inspection teams will effectively be fired. 
Blix was in Paris on his way to Cyprus, where an advance team of UN inspectors was gathering. The team is expected to fly to Baghdad tomorrow, with inspections possibly beginning on 27 November.
