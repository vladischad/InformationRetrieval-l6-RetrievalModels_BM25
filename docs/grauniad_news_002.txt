Despite three nominations, Oasis failed to collect a single gong at today's Q Awards, losing the much-coveted Best Act in the World award to Radiohead.

The Oxford band were presented with the award by cult comedians, The League of Gentlemen, at a star-studded ceremony attended by musical stars including Moby, So Solid Crew, and Ms Dynamite. This is the second year that Radiohead have taken the top award - last year their critically acclaimed album, Amnesiac, took them to the top slot.

Coldplay picked up Best Album for A Rush of Blood to the Head, beating off stiff competition from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Doves, among others. Chris Martin and his band also won the award for their debut album, Parachutes, in 2000. Coldplay, one of the few British acts to have "cracked America", were also nominated for Best Act in the World Today.

Sugababes accepted Best Single for Freak Like Me, and were presented with the award by Gary Numan, whose Are Friends Electric track was sampled for the song.

As well as awards chosen by Q Magazine readers, QTV viewers, and Q4music.com users, the event also bestowed a number of musical honours on music's veterans, including the Merit Award for Tom Jones, an Innovation Award to 80s electro rockers Depeche Mode, the Q Inspiration Award to Echo and the Bunnymen, and the Classic Songwriter Award to Jimmy Cliff.

One award that no-one was hoping to receive was the newly created Q Unwanted Award, which this year went to Simon Cowell. The smug genius behind Pop Idol was voted the person music fans most want to see banned from the awards, and one voter actually won the right to destroy Cowell's invitation and attend in his place.

Cowell beat off stiff competition for the award in the shape of fellow self-styled pop Svengali, Pete Waterman and ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.
