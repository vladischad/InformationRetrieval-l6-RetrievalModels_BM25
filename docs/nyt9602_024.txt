SMALL PLANE CRASHES INTO ATLANTIC; NO SURVIVORS FOUND

   A small single-engine plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
about eight miles off New Jersey on Wednesday. The Coast Guard
reported finding aircraft debris and a fuel slick, but no bodies or
survivors.

   The plane, which can carry four people, was seen hitting the
water shortly after 11 a.m. by a fisherman, who radioed the Coast
Guard, according to Petty Officer Jeff Fenn, a spokesman for the
base at Governors Island in New York Harbor.

   By midafternoon, several vessels and a helicopter were combing
the area about eight miles east of Sea Bright, N.J., and seven
miles south of the Ambrose Light, the Coast Guard said. The area is
55 miles from the site off Long Island where a TWA 747 crashed one
week earlier.

   Searchers found the plane's landing gear, seat cushions and
other debris, Petty Officer Fenn said. He said the water is about
125 feet deep in the crash area and that much of the wreckage had
sunk.

   The Coast Guard said the craft had taken off from Allaire
Airport in Monmouth County, N.J. The Federal Aviation
Administration said the plane was registered to Delaware
Environmental Development Service of Wilmington. There was no
listing for the company in Wilmington.
