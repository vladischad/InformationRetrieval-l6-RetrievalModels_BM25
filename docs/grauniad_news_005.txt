Shares in PowderJect today more than doubled as the British biotech company was thrust into the centre of a potential bidding war.

PowderJect, whose chief executive is Labour party donor Paul Drayson, confirmed it had received "preliminary approaches from certain companies" but added that it was "too early [to say] whether these might or might not lead to an offer being made for the company".

It has already rejected a �450m takeover approach from the American pharmaceuticals group Chiron as "opportunistic". Two other offers are believed to have been pitched at the same price.

PowderJect shares hit 600p earlier this year, but took a sharp knock this summer after it was forced to recall its BCG tuberculosis vaccine in the UK.

At the time, PowderJect was the sole supplier of BCG in Britain and Ireland. The vaccine was withdrawn after tests showed that a small number of batches were potentially less potent than normal.

The company was also embroiled in controversy after it won a �32m government contract to supply a smallpox vaccine.

The contract was made without public competition and was heavily criticised as Mr Drayson had donated �50,000 to the Labour party four months before PowderJect won the contract.

PowderJects is to release interim results in three weeks that are expected to show that it met its pre-tax forecasts of �20m for the year to March 31. Based in Oxford, the world's largest vaccine maker was up 152.5p at 407.5p in early trading,
